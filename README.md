### Folder structure
```
root
|-- config - *this folder contains all projects or clients*
|	|-- scss - *sass folder for this specific project*
|	|-- www - *folder that will be merged with /wwww*
|	|-- conf.<env>.json - *configuration file; env must be the name of the environment*
|-- hooks
|-- plugins
|-- scss - *sass folder for all apps*
|-- src - *your source file! Change only this folder!*
|	|-- i18n - *translation files, must be resouces.<language>.json*
|	|-- img - *images*
|	|-- js - *App JS files*
|	|-- lib - *external libs go to here*
|	|-- templates - *App HTML files*
|	|-- index.html - *where it all begun*
|	|-- app.conf.json - *configuration file, loaded from config/<project>*
|-- www - *compiled src, generated by build proccess - you should never change this!*
```

### Compile and Run
The compilation proccess has 2 tasks:
1. Compile and merge from *src* and *config* folder -> into *www*
2. Serve using Ionic (from *www*)

Syntax:
```
gulp <command> [--brand <brand>] [--env <env]
	
	command:
		- default
		- watch
		
	brand: your brand name (see config folder), default 'tlantic'
	env: your environment config file (inside brand), default 'dev'
```

Start by doing:
1. Open 2 command lines
2. Execute this commands by order in each terminal
	1. ```gulp watch```
	2. ```ionic serve```
	
	
Everything should work fine now... **but**:
1. When a file is deleted, you have to restart your commands again
2. If there's an error in any of them, you should restart both
